In this lecture, I learnes the following points :

What are functions?
ðŸŽ¯ Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They encapsulate a set of instructions that can be reused throughout a program.

Why are functions so important?
ðŸ’¡ Functions promote code reusability, reducing redundancy and promoting modular design.
ðŸš€ They enhance readability by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
ðŸ’¼ Functions facilitate teamwork by allowing different parts of a program to be developed and tested independently.
ðŸŒŸ Divide and Conquer: Functions implement the "divide and conquer" strategy by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems, thus simplifying the development and understanding of large-scale systems.

How to dealwith functions in C++?
ðŸ›  Function Declaration: Declare the function prototype before its first use in the code.
ðŸš§ Function Definition: Define the function body, specifying its name, return type, parameters, and implementation.
ðŸ”„ Function Call: Invoke the function by using its name followed by parentheses containing any required arguments.
ðŸ“¦ Function Parameters: Pass data to functions by specifying parameters in the function declaration and using them in the function body.
ðŸ”„ Return Statement: Use the return statement to return a value from a function to its caller, if applicable.
âš™ Function Overloading: Define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists to provide flexibility and enhance code readability.
ðŸŒŸ Divide and Conquer: Functions can implement divide and conquer algorithms by recursively breaking down a
