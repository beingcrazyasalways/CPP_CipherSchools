In this lecture, I learned the following things:

What are loops?
🔄 Loops automate repetitive tasks by executing a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.

Importance of loops:
⏳ They save time and effort by automating tasks.
📊 They efficiently process data collections.
🧩 They enhance code readability and maintainability.

Types of loops:
🔄 For loop: Executes a block of code a fixed number of times.
🔄 While loop: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
🔄 Do-while loop: Guarantees at least one execution before checking the condition.

Implementation ways of loops:
🔄 For loop: Used for a known number of iterations.
🔄 While loop: Used when the number of iterations is uncertain.

Break statement:
⛔ Terminates a loop prematurely when a condition is met.
